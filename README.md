AckTerm
=======

My fork of the "ACKTERM" at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ackterm/

"A C# .net VT/Telnet terminal emulator. The project is still very much in development but the Terminal is quite useable and fairly tolerent. It requires a c# 2 compiler. If anyone has taken this project any further, I'd love to see the results.", GEORDS - http://sourceforge.net/users/geords
